# SolveFluid Repo
## Solve fluid properties through venturis, injectors, and simple fluid systems. 

# 1. Orfice Flow
- Solve fluid (liquid/gas) properties through: orfices, injectors, and sonic/cavitating venturis.

# 2. Duct/tube/pipe flow
- Solve fluid properties through ducts with various boundary conditions, including simple: fanno, rayleigh, and isothermal flows.
